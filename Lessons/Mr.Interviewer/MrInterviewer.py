First things first you need to learn how to make single line comments and multi line comments 
so you can add little reminders or give insight on what that line of code does! comments are
fun great ways to just add notes to a line so you can reflect on them later. They wont show
up in the program its specifically for the developer(you) to look at! So single line comments
start with a hashtag (#) and anything after that will be comments in a greyish tone. Great! Now
you know how to make single line comments but what about multi line comments like this one bro?
Easy all you need to do is start the line with (3 quotes) and than anything after that will be 
comments and to end the finish off the line with another 3 quotes and viola! Your welcome I know 
I'm awesome no need to thank me! (─‿‿─)

Notice on how we are bringing life to the character by making him ask rudimentary questions
giving the feel that you are connected with mr.interviewer and giving a sense of personality is
very important to be creative during the writing process. Choose a personality for your character!
Which is the fun part you can create all type of personalities using your brain meat. Is the
character a mean or fancy type? or maybe they are cute and friendly? Role play and imagination
is really important as well but its all entirely up to you.

Variables are like little tiny safes or cardboard boxes that you can label! In them you can
insert data types from integers, strings(stirs), floating-points and values to later use
them in your file editor and is a great way to store data.
ex.( box='a cat inside of it' ) we stored "a cat inside of it" inside box making box a variable!
