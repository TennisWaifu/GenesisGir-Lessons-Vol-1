Welcome to the genesis gir lesson tutorials Volume 1! Companion Cube is a program
based on doing various tasks on guiding your companion cube to freedom and most importantly 
you! escape the robotic infrastructure and save your little cube friend out of the chaos
and i have a feeling a portal gun will be needed to overcome these challenges can you escape?
is the cake a lie?
. Thanks for downloading!

"The Python programming language has a wide range of syntactical constructions, 
standard library functions, and interactive developmeant environmeant features. 
Fortunately, you can ignore most of that; you just need to learn enough to write 
some handy little programs.

You will, however, have to learn some basic programming concepts before you can do anything.
Like a wizard in training, you might think these concepts seem arcane and tedious, 
but with some knowledge and practice, you’ll be able to command your computer like a 
magic wand and perform incredible feats." by Al Sweigart

Just like in chapter 1 Python basics he goes on to explain that it's a language that 
uses various lines of code to create handy little programs Like this one!
This volume uses python as the language 100%.

Variables are like little tiny safes or cardboard boxes that you can label! In them you can
insert data types from integers, strings(stirs), floating-points and values to later use
them in your file editor and is a great way to store data.

ex.( box='a cat inside of it' ) we stored "a cat inside of it" inside box making box a variable!

In the world we live in now a lot of new or novice programmers will run to discord servers or
sites like stack overflow for answers. These methods seem overrated to me and i highly 
suggest you branch out! Explore , Discover , Swim threw the internet and find resources other
than those two things. i have never used a discord server nor stack for learning.
you can simply dig and do things on your own and you learn quicker that way some will debate
but i could care less. programming has no rules except the functions and if you speak it correctly
Stay focused , Stay thinking outside the box! Self-taught Programmers are a thing and I
can vouch for this the art form is vast and very complex but remember the term 'Self-taught' simply
means to teach yourself the things you want to explore. Being self-taught is looked at very
indie-modern type of approach but nonetheless very beneficial. and chances are if your reading 
this you are self-taught as well!
