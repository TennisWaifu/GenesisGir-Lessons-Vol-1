Companion Cube is a program based on doing various tasks on guiding your companion cube to freedom and most importantly
you! escape the robotic infrastructure and save your little cube friend out of the chaos
and i have a feeling a portal gun will be needed to overcome these challenges can you escape?
is the cake a lie?

## Learn , Discover , Explore

In this .py you can learn a lot from what I did and discover methods I use to make things work! This is very Novice level friendly
and if you find yourself lost just make sure to look at the comments next to the lines of code to see what each line does and why
I added those functions and how they are being implemented. again this is very user friendly and very easy to understand I made
these projects so someone new to coding can learn and develop skills like I have to make their own programs and have somewhere to
start in the world of coding!

### Twitch

I also stream my progress on Twitch and store the broadcasts so subscribers can re-watch and see how i made them from scratch! I stream for hours
at a time and make sure to stop by and ask me any questions or , Chat , watch my progress!

#### learning curve

every programmer has to understand the functions and tools they have and learn at their own pace and as a novice myself i noticed these
things , I'm learning quite quickly and figured to release my programs so others can dig in and see how they work and reverse engineer
or remix them completely and study them and use them as a place to refer to. I didnt have this especially that most sites want you to
pay for their studying! ugh! Times are rough and I want to help out others who want to learn coding as much as I do.
