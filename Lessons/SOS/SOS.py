materials while fending off the erratic locals who live there! Gather Weapons , Storage , and items from
the corpses of the enemy and hope that one day you will be found. . maybe an S.O.S signal could help?

What are inputs? And why do we use them? Its important to note that inputs() are functions
that wait for the users input or intake on their keyboard to gather their keyboard presses
and calls them to the function input(). They are pretty cool! Combine them with variables to
let the user essentially set the variable for us and than later use their answers in our programs
line of code! variables can be found throughout this .py and seen in concatenation with inputs
see the text below to refer to what I'm talking about.

ex.'Line 1' print('press ENTER and flowers will bloom!') > this line is telling user to press ENTER
ex.'Line 2' input() > This line 2 is waiting for the user to press ENTER so it can switch to 3
ex.'Line 3' (  After the ENTER press as seen in Line 2 the user is now in this line! )

A great resource for novices such as myself to learn the basics of programming
if you feel that i did not explain something quite right well head over to the sight i learned
it from and how i started coding and where I began to delve into the world of code
link: >>> https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ <<< 
With tons of tutorials explaining the basis of coding I highly recommend to go here and do 
your studies and refresh your brain and gather as much information you can on the matter.
