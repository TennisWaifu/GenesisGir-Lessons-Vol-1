The print function is very useful! Yes I mean it , the function 'print()' can be used to print your strings
to stream(screen) add story lines to your code or add stirs to the source code in questions! its
very efficient has been used in some of the software or programs you are using today! check the
example below to see how to use print!

ex. print('I am Genesis Gir') > 'I Am Genesis Gir'                     

ex. print > print(select data types here) > print('hello') > 'hello'        

The final outputs are what are shown to stream(screen) when debugging or when running program
you will see the print function being used quite a lot in this source code and many of my .py files.

What are inputs? And why do we use them? Its important to note that inputs() are functions
that wait for the users input or intake on their keyboard to gather their keyboard presses
and calls them to the function input(). They are pretty cool! Combine them with variables to
let the user essentially set the variable for us and than later use their answers in our programs
line of code! variables can be found throughout this .py and seen in concatenation with inputs
see the text below to refer to what I'm talking about.

ex.'Line 1' print('press ENTER and flowers will bloom!') > this line is telling user to press ENTER
ex.'Line 2' input() > This line 2 is waiting for the user to press ENTER so it can switch to 3
ex.'Line 3' (  After the ENTER press as seen in Line 2 the user is now in this line!  )

Remember variables are just storage units for your data types like integers , floating points
strings! You can name them whatever you want as long as they dont start with a number , dont 
contain spaces or any special characters '!@#$%^&*()+' like these! variables can only have underscores
'_' in them which make them that much cooler? i dont know anyways make sure try out variables
in your file editors and try different types of directions in their uses.

ex. spam = 'cat'
The variable is now 'spam' and the string 'cat' is now stored within it! Now every time you
type spam into your file editor or an interactive shell spam will evaluate to the following.

ex. spam  (what you texted)   
ex. 'cat' (    results    )

A great resource for novices such as myself to learn the basics of programming
if you feel that i didn't explain something quite right well head over to the sight i learned
it from and how i started coding and where I began to delve into the world of code
link: >>> https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ <<< 
With tons of tutorials explaining the basis of coding I highly recommend to go here and do 
your studies and refresh your brain and gather as much information you can on the matter.
