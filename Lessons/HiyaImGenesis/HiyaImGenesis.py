Welcome to the Genesis Gir lesson tutorials Volume 1! We start off the lessons with you getting to know me! This program tells you more about me and who I am and is more like 
a cool story line about me make sure to pay attention to the functions used and the variables
how they are approached. Thanks for downloading!
""" # Multi line comments pretty useful if you wanna explain yourself
print("Hiya! Im Genesis! Lets get to know each other, what's your name?") # Greeting the user and we use the print function to do this!
name=input() # Takes input of the name variable to use later on in the program
print('Nice to meet you '+name+' I think it would be nice for us to get to know each other better?' )# Using the print function to print the string values onto the stream (screen)
print() # Empty  
print("My name's Cristian and I started doing programming about 7 days ago!") # Using print to tell user more about myself
print("and everyday I'm learning something new not only that I think it's important to train.") # More chatter with the print function!
print('The world of coding is so beautiful to me and I find myself lost doing it A LOT!') # print function being used here to generate text on stream(screen)
print() # Empty
print('What File editor do you use? I use visual studio code!') # Asking the user what text editor they use!
print() # Empty
file_editor=input() # input makes users file editor name using the input() function use it if your asking someone a question!
print() # Empty
print('Oh wow I would love to try '+file_editor+' one day who knows!') # Here we use the file_editor variable and use it to reveal their tool of choice
print() # Empty
print("I was born in New York city, Queens and it's pretty nice up there") # Yes it's true I was born in NYC also print call function
print("I'm from Baltimore and it's too loud over here and I miss my country Peru") # Telling the user that i origin from peru
print("That's where my parents are from and the food there is amazing!") # Using the print call function to display text
print() # Another cute empty line! Wanna do this just use the print() call function
print('Anyways where are you from?') # asking the user where are they from
print() # empty line
location=input() # Making the user's input the location to be stored in the variable
print() # Another empty line of space to make the texts have room
print(location +" sounds nice, I'd like to go travel there sometime. I love traveling!") # Using the location variable to reveal where they are from!
print() # Empty line space 
print("I'm also into spicy foods and I'm spanish as well! And Im a huge gamer.") # More chit chat with print()
print() # Giving room for the text to breathe by making an empty line
print('Whats your favorite video game?') # Asking user what their favorite is game is with the print function
game=input() # User's input becomes game variable and is later used later down the program
print() # Empty line use the print() call function to use this function
print(game+ '?'+' Hmm sounds nice I should try it some time hehe') # Using print() to have a friendly conversation
print() # Empty line
print('Im glad that we got to know each other see you in the next tutorial '+name+ 'see ya!') # Using print and a variable in tandem to create atmosphere
print() # I used the print() call function to create some more room between the lines
print('Genesis gathered that your name is '+name+'.') # Telling the user that we know their name based off variables
print('Genesis gathered that your from '+location+'.') # Telling the user that we know their location based off variables
print('Genesis gathered that you like video games like '+game+'.') # Telling the user  that we know what game they like based off variables
print() # An empty void of text and a long line of nothing created with the print() function
# The program exits here (38 lines in total!)

Did you enjoy the little program I made? Did it teach you more about coding or me? I hope so because make sure to study and research this source code over and over until you understand
its functions and methods! We used variables, functions, and clever creative ways to interact
with the user and learn about them and what they like and share about ourselves as well. 
Pretty remarkable I'd say. Below are the functions used and what they do.
Variables - Think of them like a cardboard box you can box your data types in!
They are very handy when you need to gather information or even capture a users input and later on
reveal the variable in the program for whatever your reason. Variables store data like integers 
floats, strings! Pretty essential!
input - Prints the value to stream and takes input from the user on keyboard and enter
the input function can be used in a lot of creative ways, insert it when you want to gather a users answer
and store them in variables for later use. Ask a question in print then after that link make a variable
with an assignmeant operator and put input it will take the users input whatever they texted.
