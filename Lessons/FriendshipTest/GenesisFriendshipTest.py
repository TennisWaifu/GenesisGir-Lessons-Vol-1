The print function always comes with two parentheses and any function in that matter and we 
enter what data types we want inside of them and everything inside of it is called an
argument and the print is called a function and in this case im using a (stir) or better known
as a string to make a storyline! so print(    ) and anything inside it will be printed onto 
stream(screen) just make sure its a correct data type: integer , float or a string value.

input() waits for the users keyboard input and when they press enter it takes that input
this can be very essential to make variables by the user and can be used to your advantage
make sure to practice input() often! And in line 55 I'm using the input() function
to create a variable using the users input to later use it in the program

Variables are like little tiny safes or cardboard boxes that you can label! In them you can
insert data types from integers, strings(stirs), floating-points and values to later use
them in your file editor and is a great way to store data.
ex.( box='a cat inside of it' ) we stored "a cat inside of it" inside box making box a variable!

Integers are values and whole numbers that can be used to make expressions! They are important when
it comes down to using them in your code! Integers are different than floats because they don't contain
a decimal or decimals within them integers are a data type as well!

ex. -3 , -2 , -1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5  are said to be integer numbers and values

Finding different workflows while writing code can benefit the developer in finding quicker ways
to do things like a nifty app like ClipClip can enhance work flows and its important to sharpen
your workflow in a way that makes things easier for you! Remember just because we speak the same
language doesn't mean our workflows are the same. Find your manner of writing your scripts and
harness its ability to get faster and faster with flows. Branching out to new software that helps
with copy & pasting functionalities for instance would help to write lines of code down quicker!
