Driving a Storyline is not as easy as just throwing random things on the wall! Use your creativity!
Passion, Ideology , and Fun ways to make the code readable and yet fun! In this .py we bring the user 
into a unmarked planet called pandora and go full frontal with the concepts and manners of Storylines.
Sure we are limited by only using the enter key. . for now. Because chapter one only teaches us certain
methods, drive your story and put your love and energy into it like its a movie set! You can really pull in
a users attention wanting more Throw them some scenarios that will blow them away have them wanting more
if you can do this only with limited amount of functions and enter you'll do that much more with more functions 
later on!

What are inputs? And why do we use them? Its important to note that inputs() are functions
that wait for the users input or intake on their keyboard to gather their keyboard presses
and calls them to the function input(). They are pretty cool! Combine them with variables to
let the user essentially set the variable for us and than later use their answers in our programs
line of code! variables can be found throughout this .py and seen in concatenation with inputs
see the text below to refer to what I'm talking about.

ex.'Line 1' print('press ENTER and flowers will bloom!') > this line is telling user to press ENTER
ex.'Line 2' input() > This line 2 is waiting for the user to press ENTER so it can switch to 3
ex.'Line 3' (  After the ENTER press as seen in Line 2 the user is now in this line! )

enter what data types we want inside of them and everything inside of it is called an
argument and the print is called a function and in this case im using a (stir) or better known

Variables are like little tiny safes or cardboard boxes that you can label! In them you can
insert data types from integers, strings(stirs), floating-points and values to later use
them in your file editor and is a great way to store data.

ex.( vehicle='B250 Destroyer' ) we stored "B250 Destroyer" inside the box making vehicle a variable!

The len function is a cool way to generate integers with using 'Len()' very useful for any situation
but what it really does would confuse some but in the end all it does is returns the number of items
in a container or string value or anything inside the container explained below.


ex. len() > len('candy') > 5

as you see from process from left to right it takes whatever is inside and returns
the number of items in the container! really can be used in a situations that need it or dont 
use it whatever floats ya boat! Check out line '334' to see this in action

Exactly what it means even with a simple one key press experience you can still plunge the
user into an experience that has exciting tangents like a loot system or a XP system really cool!
to digress what is going on below is rather easy its using variables and print to create
a loot system where the user can open loot boxes and get weapons that you set out for them! Ugh!
I love this coding stuff it really goes to show how amazing programming is!

ex. GunName='Name Of weapon (LEVEL 5!)' We create the gun name variable here

print('(Open [Common Shotgun Loot box]?)') Here we let the user what they are going to open!
 
print('(press enter to open!)') prompts user to press enter! here we tell the user to press enter

input() The user will press enter here

print('Obtained:'+GunName+'!') We add the Gun Name variable to the String!

print('(press enter)') We tell the user to get ready to press enter

input() and user presses enter here! Viola!

Conventionally they are converters and change the opposite data types into the ones they are
can be very beneficial if for example you have a integer in a print line and needs to be string
all you gotta do is convert it to string data type. How? str(50) and than the output will be
'50' again all this stuff is experimeantation but in the long run they convert data types. A basic
rule of thumb is to always refer to the chapter 1 page of automate the boring stuff's website!

Stay obsessed with your code and work, if you find yourself getting bored take a nap , watch youtube
go take a break outside and then come back fully charged to take on the source code in it's full form!
Trust em when i say your code wants you to be partners and is not against you so fuel yourself with little
breaks , look after yourself and know when too much is enough and come back later or be a try hard its fun.

A great resource for novices such as myself to learn the basics of programming
if you feel that i didnt explain something quite right well head over to the sight i learned
it from and how i started coding and where I began to delve into the world of code
link: >>> https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ <<< 
With tons of tutorials explaining the basis of coding I highly reccomend to go here and do 
your studies and refresh your brain and gather as much information you can on the matter.
