# GENESIS GIR VOLUME 1
Welcome to (GGVL1) Genesis Gir Volume 1 in this segmeant youll be diving and digging threw the various programs I created over the past weeks to better understand workflows
and to see how coding works overall and if your especially new to coding like I am these will be very beneficial to any novice or expert to understand the craft
how it works, blends, shape-shifts, evolves overtime.Dont worry I've explained the lines of code in great detail and everything is set out for you to learn
with the confidence that you can make your own programs in the future but remember to reference the website included in these files to get the extra mile
when learning with tandem with these .py files also make sure to stay on the chapter 1 page of automatetheboringstuff to better learn these functionalities
everything was written for the ease of the novice and this volume contains 10 .py files to explore.

This volume contains

- ALovelyDate
- CompanionCube 
- CotalsSushiShop
- FriendshipTest
- HiyaImGenesis
- MoogleSynthesizerULTRA
- Mr.Interviewer
- Pandora
- SOS

9 project files to learn from by me so you can take every bit of knowledge when it comes to learning to make handy little programs to start out with 
and as the volumes rise the difficulty getting harder and more diverse which means more fun and more exciting code.as far for this volume you can only
press enter to interact with these files but I've attempted to make them as fun as possible and interesting for the users and the learner! So please enjoy these
and hopefully someone learns from these cause I am obsessed with this artform and with dedication you can make your own programs and practice everyday
