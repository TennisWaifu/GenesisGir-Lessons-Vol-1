Welcome to the genesis gir lesson tutorials Volume 1! Kupo! Moogle Synthesizer Shop takes the user
to different worlds to collect attributes to create the Elixir Shard Potion with the help of
a cute Moogle named Jixo as they set out on fun interactive tasks to finally put together the 
concatenation of component's! A magical experience super fun to learn variables as well. use your
Keyblade to fight for the light and save the world from the lost!
Thanks for downloading!

enter what data types we want inside of them and everything inside of it is called an

What are inputs? And why do we use them? Its important to note that inputs() are functions
that wait for the users input or intake on their keyboard to gather their keyboard presses
and calls them to the function input(). They are pretty cool! Combine them with variables to
let the user essentially set the variable for us and than later use their answers in our programs
line of code! variables can be found throughout this .py and seen in concatenation with inputs
see the text below to refer to what I'm talking about.

ex.'Line 1' print('press ENTER and heartless will spawn!') > this line is telling user to press ENTER
ex.'Line 2' input() > This line 2 is waiting for the user to press ENTER so it can switch to 3
ex.'Line 3' (  After the ENTER press as seen in Line 2 the user is now in this line! )

Variables are like little tiny safes or cardboard boxes that you can label! In them you can
insert data types from integers, strings(stirs), floating-points and values to later use
them in your file editor and is a great way to store data.

ex.( Moo='Jixo The Moogle' ) we stored "Jixo The Moogle" inside 'Moo' making 'Moo' a variable!

Conventionally they are converters and change the opposite data types into the ones they are
can be very beneficial if for example you have a integer in a print line and needs to be string
all you gotta do is convert it to string data type. How? str(50) and than the output will be
'50' again all this stuff is experimeantation but in the long run they convert data types. A basic
rule of thumb is to always refer to the chapter 1 page of automate the boring stuff's website!
